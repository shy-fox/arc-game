# The Arc Game
A very simple and short browser game where you do nothing but collect points. It took not long to write, but is very complex, at least for what it is.
> Also, please do not hate on me for stuff like this:
> ```js
> if (arc.unlocked &&
>   ((currentMultiplierElement == null || !statTags[index] || statTags[index]['mult'] !== arc.multiplier) &&
>   (currentSpeedElement == null || !statTags[index] || statTags[index]['spd'] !== arc.time))) {
> ```
> It's like 11 PM and I am tired as hell.
